Are you ready for amazing 1 vs 1 battles?

Requirements:

Pillow (pip3 install pillow)

To run the application properly:

cd client
python3 main.py

The default settings are set to connect the digital ocean. 

If you want to run it, on local you can change the HOST variable in server/server.py (Line 8) and client/main.py (Line 8).

If you got any errors from the server, you can contact me to reset the server. :D
